Machine Larning Types:
1) Supervised Learning 
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Semi-Supervised Learning
4) Reinforcement Learning
================================================================================================================================

1) Supervised Learning: If we have our Data Input and output and our work is to find relationship bitween them so that we can tell output for new inputs it's called "Supervised Larning".
Ex.: Student placed or not with IQ and CGPA bases.

IQ      CGPA        Y/N placed
87      7.1         Y
111     8.9         Y
75      6.3         N

Data Types:
1) numerical Data- age, CGPA, IQ
2)Categorical- gender, nationality

|-> i) Regration: if our Target/output column data is 'Numerical Data' so that Supervised ML Problame called "Regration".

Ex.: Student Packag/Salary or not with IQ and CGPA bases.

IQ      CGPA        Salary/Packag
87      7.1         12LPA
111     8.9         18LPA
75      6.3         Nun

|-> ii) Classification:if our Target/output column data is 'Categorical Data' so that Supervised ML Problame called "Classification".

Ex.: Student placed or not with IQ and CGPA bases.

IQ      CGPA        Y/N placed
87      7.1         Y
111     8.9         Y
75      6.3         N

2) Unsupervised Learning:If we have only Inputs in our Data so it's called "Unsupervised Larning".

|-> i) Clustering: Gropping the same value that called "Clustering"

|-> ii) Dimentionality Reduction: Remove Extra columns form Dtaaset so decresed   

|-> iii) Anamoly Detection:

|-> iv) Assosiation Rule Learning:
